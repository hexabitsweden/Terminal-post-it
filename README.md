```
Not yet implemented (later this week maybe)
but there is some sample notes with help and 
info about all the commands.
```

### Prerequisites

Only tested on FreeBSD (Developed on FreeBSD 8) and a couple of Linux distros such as Ubuntu, Arch etc.
It wont compile on MacOS (yet). 

This is probably the shitiest piece of code on the planet but it works.

_if it ain't broken, don't fix it_
